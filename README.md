### Data acquisition platform 
![Example](figures/platform.jpg)
Our data acquisition platform with beam splitter equipment, which enables us to collect real-world degraded-clean image pairs simultaneously. (a) Schematic diagram of our beam splitter equipment.
(b) Physical Diagram of our beam splitter equipment. (c) Pathological sections used in dataset collection.

### Dataset Property
![Example](figures/properties.jpg)
There are 48 different diseases in our dataset, and the number of diseases varies because of the different sizes of tissue sections.

### Clustering Visualization
![Example](figures/gmm.jpg)
Top: Visualizing GIST features of our dataset using t-sne and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM). Bottom: Cluster-center example of each cluster.

### Comparison with Previous Datasets
![Example](figures/Comparison.jpg)
The datasets are synthesized using single degradation factor (a) and multiple degradation factors (b). In contrast, the images in our dataset are degraded in real-world conditions (c), specifically due to the challenging environments encountered in fiber-bundle endomicroscopy.

### Image Complexity Analysis
![Example](figures/PSNR.jpg)
Our dataset contains a significantly higher proportion of challenging examples characterized by low PSNR and SSIM scores.
