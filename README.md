### Data acquisition platform 
![Example]()
Our data acquisition platform with beam splitter equipment, which enables us to collect real-world degraded-clean image pairs simultaneously. (a) Schematic diagram of our beam splitter equipment.

### Dataset Property
![Example]()
There are 48 different diseases in our dataset, and the number of diseases varies because of the different sizes of tissue sections.
